Overlay for Gentoo/Linux packages

The following packages are available in this overlay:

## Warning

This overlay is not official and it is not available in layman's repository.

**Use ebuilds supplied in this repository on your own risk**. They've been tested on my own system setup (~amd64) and (most likely) tested on virtual systems (amd64 and x86).

## Installing
